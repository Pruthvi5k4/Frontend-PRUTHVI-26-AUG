<p style="color:green;background-color:yellow;font-size:20px" >Living conditions  are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which
 people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term ‘living 
 conditions’ is closely related to that of ‘quality of life.’ The latter is the 
 degree to which an individual is healthy, comfortable and able to participate 
 in or enjoy life events. The term ‘quality of life’ then can refer to both the 
 experience an individual has of his or her own life and to the living conditions
 in which individuals find themselves.Due to the health and ensuing economic 
 crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic, the study of living conditions and 
 quality of life has gained even more importance. Eurofound investigates the impact
 of the economic crisis on the living conditions of Europeans in different life
 stages and the role played by various initiatives implemented to alleviate the 
 social hardship of various groups of citizens. The Agency will continue to
 monitor trends in this area in light of this new challenge. </p><br><br><br>
